/*
 * lcd_panels.h
 *
 * This header file declares the lcd_panel_info_t
 * data type and the num_lcd_panels and lcd_panels
 * constants for use in initializing a variety of displays.
 *
 * Note that this is based on the pxafb_mach_info structure
 * in linux-2.4.19/drivers/video/pxafb.h (Nico's patches),
 * but differs in a couple of respects:
 *
 *    Doesn't support the color-mapping stuff
 *    Includes an 'active' flag
 *
 * Doesn't include the lccr0 and lccr3 fields, since most of
 * the fields in those registers are display controller options,
 * not panel options, and the others (so far) can have reasonable
 * defaults. When (if) we need to support a non-standard display,
 * we can fill in the blanks with defaults in the previously
 * supported displays and compute lccr0 and lccr3.
 *
